 My name is Sebastian Jensen.
 
 I am Postdoc at Aarhus University, Denmark, working on Climate Econometrics and Machine Learning. 

 I have developed a novel, ***Neural Network-based panel data methodology*** together with colleagues from Aarhus University Professor Eric Hillebrand and Associate Professor Mikkel Bennedsen, which combines cross-sectional and/or time-specific fixed effects with a nonparametric Neural Network regression component. More information can be found in the two papers:
 * [A Neural Network Approach to the Environmental Kuznets Curve]() by Bennedsen, Hillebrand and Jensen (2021), and
 * [Apocalypse Now? Future Emissions Projections using Neural Networks]() by Bennedsen, Hillebrand and Jensen (2021).

The Python source code needed to apply the proposed methodology and to reproduce the results of these two papers can be found in my Git repository [Neural-Networks-for-Panel-Data](https://github.com/Sebastian-Jensen/Neural-Networks-for-Panel-Data).

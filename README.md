 My name is Sebastian Jensen.
 
 I am PhD student at Aarhus University, Denmark, working on Climate Econometrics and Machine Learning. 
 
 My research focuses mainly on how traditional econometric techniques can be combined with modern Machine Learning algorithms to develop novel and superior tools and methods.

 I have developed a novel, ***Neural Network-based panel data methodology*** together with colleagues from Aarhus University Professor Eric Hillebrand and Assistant Professor Mikkel Bennedsen, which combines cross-sectional and/or time-specific fixed effects with a nonparametric Neural Network regression component. More information can be found in the two papers:
 * [A Neural Network Approach to the Environmental Kuznets Curve](https://github.com/Sebastian-Jensen/A-Neural-Network-Approach-to-the-Environmental-Kuznets-Curve) by Bennedsen, Hillebrand and Jensen (2021), and
 * [Apocalypse Now? Future Emissions Projections using Neural Networks](https://github.com/Sebastian-Jensen/Apocalypse-Now-Future-Emissions-Projections-using-Neural-Networks) by Bennedsen, Hillebrand and Jensen (2021).

The code needed to reproduce the results of these two papers and to apply the proposed methodology can be found in my repositories.

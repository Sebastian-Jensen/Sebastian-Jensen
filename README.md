 My name is Sebastian Jensen.
 
 I am Postdoc at Aarhus University, Denmark, working on Climate Econometrics and Machine Learning. 

 I have developed a novel, ***Neural Network-based panel data methodology*** together with colleagues from Aarhus University Professor Eric Hillebrand and Associate Professor Mikkel Bennedsen, which combines cross-sectional and/or time-specific fixed effects with a nonparametric Neural Network regression component. More information can be found in the two papers:
 * [A Neural Network Approach to the Environmental Kuznets Curve](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323004838?via%3Dihub) by Bennedsen, Hillebrand, and Jensen (2023), 
 * [Apocalypse Now? Projecting CO2 Emissions with Neural Networks](https://pure.au.dk/portal/files/225863920/PhD_dissertation_Sebastian_Mathias_Jensen.pdf#page=89) by Bennedsen, Hillebrand, and Jensen (2021).

The Python source code and data needed to apply the proposed methodology and to reproduce the results of the two papers will be available in my repository ASAP!

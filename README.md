 My name is Sebastian Jensen.
 
 I am Postdoc at Aarhus University, Denmark, working on Climate Econometrics and Machine Learning. 

 I have developed a novel, ***Neural Network-based panel data methodology*** together with colleagues from Aarhus University Eric Hillebrand and Mikkel Bennedsen, which combines fixed effects with a Neural Network regression component. More information can be found in the two papers:
 * [A Neural Network Approach to the Environmental Kuznets Curve](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323004838?via%3Dihub) by Bennedsen, Hillebrand, and Jensen (2023), 
 * [Apocalypse Now? Projecting CO2 Emissions with Neural Networks](https://pure.au.dk/portal/files/225863920/PhD_dissertation_Sebastian_Mathias_Jensen.pdf#page=89) by Bennedsen, Hillebrand, and Jensen (2021).

Python code for applying the proposed methodology and for reproducing the results of the paper ***A Neural Network Approach to the Environmental Kuznets Curve*** is available in [this repository](https://github.com/Sebastian-Jensen/A-Neural-Network-Approach-to-the-Environmental-Kuznets-Curve). Python code for reproducing the results of the paper ***Apocalypse Now? Projecting CO2 Emissions with Neural Networks*** will be available ASAP.
